About
=====

*nclogin* is a user login utility with ncurses-based UI.
It is meant to be used as a replacement for the traditional
combination of agetty(8) and login(1) on the Linux console.

It can also be used as a lightweight replacement for
a local X display manager to start an X.Org session.

Requirements
============

Libraries: ncurses (libncurses and libform).

Build tools: gcc with C99 support, GNU make.

Installation
============

Just run "make" in the top directory and then copy
the binary and the manpage to wherever appropriate.
